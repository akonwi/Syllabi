Syllabi
=================
This is a very simple app I created because I wanted a way to view my syllabi, schedules, and other important often referenced documents without having to open my backpack or notebook. Android and Java are not my cup of tea so this app probably disregards Android development style and best practices. It is pretty half-baked and not fully fledged out yet but that is why I'm open sourcing it. The app is in the play store for free so any substantial changes will be pushed into the production app.

I'd be thrilled if anyone else contributed to this because it's an idea that has a lot of great potential but I'm too lazy and annoyed to commit to android development. 

Todo's I'd like to implement
------------------
* More information surrounding each item(date, time, even notes?)
* Sorting based on date/time
* A decent logo(the current one makes me want to cry but it's all I could do)
* Whatever else the community wants to see
